## Overview

Data Set 9 has historically been the **largest, most unstable, and most complex**
of the Epstein Files releases.

Unlike other datasets, DS09:

* was distributed via an incomplete and unreliable ZIP
* circulated in multiple **partial community reconstructions**
* required reconciliation using metadata (`.DAT` / `.OPT`) files
* included both PDFs and a large number of **NATIVEs (media files)**
* **was the largest EFTA release to date**

This document exists to preserve **context, evolution, and verification paths**
without overloading the main index.

---

## Current Status Summary

As of the latest update:

* DS09 is **not yet 100% complete**
* Community reconciliation indicates **~99.9% reconstructable by file count**
* Remaining gaps primarily affect:

  * a small number of PDFs
  * unrecovered or placeholder NATIVEs

⚠️ Completeness is measured by **file presence**, not byte-for-byte parity.

---

## Recommended Sources (Current)

The following represent the **currently recommended DS09 sources**.

These are the sources linked and maintained in the **main README**.

* Community flattened archive (PDFs only)
* Community ~140 GB archive (broader coverage)

> See the main README for live links, sizes, and hashes.

This section intentionally avoids duplicating magnets to ensure a **single
authoritative surface**.

## Historical Sources & Magnets

This section preserves **all known historical DS09 sources** that circulated
during early preservation and reconstruction efforts.

These sources are **not recommended for new downloads**, but are retained for
archival and forensic completeness.

## Reconstruction & Analysis Notes

Early DS09 recovery efforts involved:

* merging multiple partial community archives
* deduplicating by filename and size
* reconciling expected file counts using `.DAT` manifests
* identifying missing PDFs and NATIVEs

These workflows are preserved here for **historical reference**.

Current recovery efforts focus on:

* publicly accessible DOJ endpoints
* direct verification of missing entries
* incremental recovery rather than bulk recombination

---

## NATIVEs & Placeholder Analysis

DS09 includes a significant number of **NATIVEs** (media files).

Observed behaviors include:

* placeholder files of consistent small sizes
* missing DOJ endpoints for some native entries
* overlap with known NATIVEs from other datasets

Key notes:

* Placeholder sizes observed: *4670 b, 2433 b*
* Estimated expected NATIVEs: *2542*
* Confirmed recoverable NATIVEs: *1983*

Detailed lists and notes are maintained in accompanying files under
`notes/DS09/`.

---

## Deprecated / Removed Sources

Some DS09 sources and workflows were **removed from the main README** to:

* reduce confusion for new users
* avoid recommending obsolete or inferior sources
* maintain a clear “current state” index

Those sources are preserved here intentionally.

Removal from the main README **does not imply invalidation or suppression**.

---

## Timeline of Availability

* DOJ releases Data Set 9 ZIP (incomplete / unstable)
* Early partial community magnets circulate (~45 GB)
* Deduplicated community composites appear (~89.5 GB)
* Larger community archive circulates (~140 GB)
* Current recommended sources consolidated in main README

This document captures that evolution.

---

## Relationship to Main README

* **Main README:**
  Stable, forward-facing index with current recommended sources

* **This document:**
  DS09-specific deep dive, history, and archival record

The two are intentionally separated to balance **clarity** and **transparency**.

---

## Maintenance Notes

* This document is **append-only**
* Historical entries are not removed once documented
* Updates may add context, annotations, or clarifications

This file exists so DS09 can be understood **even years later**, regardless of
how sources change.

## Data Set 9 — Status, Reconstruction, and Analysis

⚠ **Data Set 9 has historically been incomplete and unstable when accessed via DOJ direct download.**
Multiple users have reported download cutoffs (commonly around **~49 GB of ~180 GB**), HTTP 404s, paginator failures, and IP-based blocking.

These issues have been observed across multiple regions and do not appear to be user-specific.

---

## Reconstruction Status (Current)

Data Set 9 reconstruction efforts are **ongoing**, but the methodology has evolved.

Earlier recovery work focused on consolidating multiple **partial community archives**. That process is no longer actively documented here, as the current focus is on:

* Recovering remaining files **directly from DOJ endpoints**
* Verifying expected file counts against official `.DAT` / `.OPT` manifests
* Enumerating missing, placeholder, or inaccessible **NATIVEs**

The most complete publicly available DS09 compilations are documented in the **main README**.

Historical reconstruction methods, intermediate sources, and deprecated magnets are preserved in:

* this document
* the Git commit history
* issue discussions

This separation is intentional and exists to maintain clarity while preserving transparency.

## Reconstruction Completeness Estimate (~99.9%)

**Update:** As of early **February 2026**, reconciliation using official dataset metadata (`.DAT` / `.OPT`) indicates that Data Set 9 is now **~99.9% reconstructable by file count** from currently circulating public sources.

### What “~99.9%” Means (High-Level)

Based on manifest analysis:

* **~531,307** expected `IMAGES` entries (PDFs)
* **~531,282** PDFs currently recovered
* **~25 PDFs** remain missing

In addition:

* **~2,542** expected `NATIVES` (media files)
* **1,983 NATIVEs** confirmed as **directly downloadable from DOJ sources**
* Remaining NATIVEs appear as:

  * small placeholder files
  * or entries lacking publicly accessible DOJ endpoints

Taken together, this places DS09 at approximately **~99.9% complete by file count**, where completeness reflects:

> **PDFs + recoverable native/media files**

This does **not** imply byte-for-byte parity or canonical completeness.

> **Important:**
> This document does **not** claim Data Set 9 is fully complete or authoritative.
> It records the best-known public reconstruction status based on community analysis at the time of writing.

## NATIVEs Placeholder Analysis & Recovery Status

### Placeholder Characteristics

Two distinct placeholder file sizes have been consistently observed:

* **4670 bytes**
* **2433 bytes**

This behavior was identified by comparing placeholder files in **Data Set 9** against known NATIVEs from **Data Set 10**.

---

### Revised Estimates

Based on this analysis, the estimated number of missing NATIVEs was revised:

* **Previous estimate:** ~135 files
* **Revised estimate:** **~2,542 files**

Additionally:

* **~25 image (PDF) files** remain missing
* Some missing images may overlap with native placeholder entries

---

### Recovery Progress

As of the latest update:

* **1,983 / 2,542 NATIVEs** have been confirmed as **directly downloadable from DOJ sources**
* Remaining NATIVEs are **still under active investigation**
